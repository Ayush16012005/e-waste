Many of these toxic materials are known or suspected to cause harm to human health, and several are included in the 10 chemicals of public health concern, including dioxins, lead and mercury. <br> <br>Electronic waste or e-waste, is discarded electrical or electronic devices that contain hazardous substances and can be harmful to the environment and human health. <br>
<br>Millions of tonnes of e-waste are recycled using unsound activities, as well as being stored in homes and warehouses, dumped, and illegally exported.
